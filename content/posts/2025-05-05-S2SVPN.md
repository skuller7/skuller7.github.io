## IPsec protocol

IPSec or Internet Protocol security if actually a group of protocols that are formed to set  up a secure Logical medium/line across an unsecure Network.
IPSec procol group is fundemental for todays Enterprise Networks, there are number of great benefits of implementing IPSec.
The 3 fundemental ones are Authetification, Encryption and Hashing.
- o	With authetifcation, both parties can prove its identities by using a Authetifcation protcol, I will be using PSK
- o	Encryption is one of the main component of IPSec, With Secure Encryption symetric and asymetric algorithms, our data is safe over the public network
- o	Hashing is a concept where we can be sure so that our payloads are not modified or altered during transmission, this protects us from MiTM attacks

## How IPSec works (from my point of view)

IPSec works with something called IKE, internet key excange and itâ€™s a standard protocol used to create a secure and private link, this WAN link is called a Tunnel

Virtual Tunnel is a logical communication link that traverses thorugh the public network, a VPN tunnel makes it secure cos a combination of symetric and asymetric algorthims are applied to make the tunnel encryped and fully secure.

So here is how It looks this in practise, we have a device in an private network or a LAN, that device has an internet access though a Router, with NAT or PAT that device first stop is the local ISP, from the ISP there is probably some redundancy to that same ISP different site and this is actually WAN connections.
By using the VPN Tunneling we can ensure that our device when it reaches the local Router from there our data is not visable to anyones other than the Router that is the second peer from there it is decrypted, and the host on Site B will get the right payload.

## Site to Site VPN

Site to Site VPN or S2S, is one of the most common types of VPN's implemented in todays networks.
In S2S VPN tunnels or SA's connect multiple sites or just 2 over a WAN link.
At each site VPN gateway encrypts and encapsulates data to exchange over the SA with sites VPN Gateway
Devices in Site A can talk to devices in Site B 
They are typically implemented when a company needs redundancy and not a dedicated line that would cost them, they work over the public internet.

## Overview of our lab demostration and prepare phase

We have 2 sites, Site A and Site B.
Site A just has a VPC and its directly connected to its Router.
Site B also has a VPC and its direclty connected to its Router.
The Routers are directly connected for simplicity and Hardware utilizaton.
Policies need to match on both sites For IKEv1 Phase 1 - Building the SA
ACL needs to be applied correctly on both sites
PSK also needs to be set on set up correclty on 2 peers.

## IPSec VPN Phase 1 configuration

First we will be configuring the Phase 1 of IKEv1, this phase is called the build phase.
It is called that way cos we need to plan the policies for both parties(routers)
So we will agree for both routers to be configured this way :
    - Encryption AES 256 (Symetric encryption)
    - Hashing SHA 256
    - Authetication Pre Shared keys (PSK Secret)
    - Diffie Hellman Group Number 5
    - Lifetime of the SA is 7000 secons
Once we got the plan lets get to configuring the isakmp (IKE on Cisco IOS)
(One more important thing before configuring is that you need a license on a Cisco router, you need a securityk9-univerisal license. The Cisco CSR1000V has that but utilizes a lot of memory)

IKEv1 Phase 1 config
```cisco
R1(config)#
R1(config)#crypto isakmp policy 5
R1(config-isakmp)#authentication pre-share 
R1(config-isakmp)#hash sha256
R1(config-isakmp)#encryption aes 256
R1(config-isakmp)#group 5
R1(config-isakmp)#lifetime 5000
``` 

Also not to forget add the ISAKMP key the PSK we enabled,
```cisco
R1(config)#crypto isakmp key UrosCCNA address 0.0.0.0
```
