This was an mini project i did in Azure where i did the following.
I set up an Network in the Cloud using an architecture Hub and Spoke.
Inside that Hub vNet was the Windows Server 2019 DC VM and on the spoke vNet were Windows 10 clients VM.
An Azure P2S VPN was configured to access the internal network
Configured and Set up Active Directory, added the Clients to the Domain
Implemented Policy specific on clients VM's through GPO.
