## Linux LVM In Azure 

![LVM](/images/LVM-logo.png)

LVM or Logical Volume Manager is an technology and a way of better managing your storage capacity with disks. 
Basically it allows you to use multiple disks HDD or SDDs and better manage them than you would with traditonal partiotning.
In addition to that one of the charcterics and benefits is that you could resize the LV with one command and scale your storage.

## LAB overview

I will be creating a basic VM in azure, by configuring a RG where the VM will be stored, also in an single Region US-east (default)
For the VM it be a standard Ubuntu Server, so that we want to be minimalistic as possible, for the networking leave everything by default and enable inbound p22 for SSH access
The storage is important, 1 main disk for root file system. and 2 additional SSD disks which we will configure.
On that VM we will create the physical volumes, VG and finally the LV. In additon we will also apply a FS and mount the LV's
In the end we will resize the VG's with an additonal disk that i will create later in Azure and resize the FS.
And some sort of encryption so we can secure our data.

### Deploying VM in Azure
In these images i created 1 VM as we mentioned above, a typical VM deployment
Main disk is 30 gigs and the additonal two are 16gigs each.

Also i am gonna authetihcate via SSH protocol using a password, you can use asymetric encryption if you like.
On this second command i run the lsblk command which lists the block devices on our Linux system
The 2 added disks where LVM is gonna be configured are /dev/sda & /dev/sdb

### LVM Configuriation

The first step when we start configuring the LVM is the PV or Physical volumes these are essentially our drives that we have above the /dev/sda & /dev/sdb 
For some reason they need to registered as PV's
To manipulate with them you first need to create them, list them and even display them if you want.
They are super easy to use just specify the device names and you can create the PV's.
![PhysicalVolumep1](/images/PhysicalVolume-p1.png)
physical volumes are created, so now using the command pvs and pvscan we can scan them on Ubuntu VM
It checks out all the individual physical volumes that belong to a particular LVM setup.
![PhysicalVolumep2](/images/PhysicalVolume-p2.png)
![PhysicalVolumep3](/images/PhysicalVolume-p3.png)

Now that we have our PVs we can create a Volume Group that enables us to have one giant pool where we can later use sections for particular use-cases (just like Network subnets)
The command is straightforward the vgcreate
I specified the name of MAIN_VG 
![VolumeGroup1](/images/VolumeGroup-p1.png)
We specified the pv’s and using the command vgscan it found the created VG.
Also when we run the command vgs we get more information about it 
![VolumeGroup2](/images/VolumeGroup-p2.png)

After the VG we have LV, once created in order to use it we need to apply a fs and mount it. 
They contain the file system and are attached to the physical volumes through volume groups.
So by carving the free storage from the VG we get an LV 
![LogicalVolume1](/images/LogicalVolume-p1.png)
I used 13 gigs out of the 32 gigs from the VG, for that LV called LV1

Now we can verify and validate what we did using the command lvdisplay command which is very useful cos there is information about the size of LV and from which pool of VG is it used, there are cases where there could be multiple VGs so this is a nice outline.
![LogicalVolume2](/images/LogicalVolume-p2.png)
Now if we run the vgdisplay command the allocated PE is what is being used in LV1
Also we have the remaining 18.99 gigs of storage for other LVs
I created another LV with 10 gigs of storage.
Here is how it looks like when we run the lvscan and lvs
![LogicalVolume3](/images/LogicalVolume-p3.png)
We have a total of 23 gigs used from that VG, meaning we have 8.99 gigs left. 

### Formating and Mounting LVs

Now once the LVs are created, lets actually use them,  for that we need some sort of file system for Linux, so we can store files and directories.
Linux systems use ext4 ext3 or even XFS
Also all the configuration will go into the LV1, I will save the LV2 for something else.
![FS-1](/images/FileSystemMount-p1.png)
Now we can confirm this by using a command disktype.
That is the first step after that lets add a mountpoint for this LV so its use-able.
![FS-2](/images/FileSystemMount-p2.png)
![FS-3](/images/FileSystemMount-p3.png)
Using the command disk free on linux we can see all mountpoints on our system.
The imporatnt one is down below /dev/mapper/MAIN_VG-LV1 
Also one more thing, cos this mini lab is gonna take 2 days to finish I added an entry in the /dev/stab so when I reboot the VM the mountpoint wont just disapear.

### Re-Size VG & LV's

Another great feature of LVM’s is that we can add more and more disks and add them to the VG pool. This is a cool feature cos we don’t have any storage left and the benefit of appening more storage to the VG is a good idea.
but if we want to do that we gonna start from the beginning 
So basically create a new PV, add it to the VG pool and the use in an LV.
So on Azure I added a new standard disk of 32 gigs 
![ReSize-p1](/images/resizeLV-p1.png)
And now on the image I resized the VG pool and now we have 40.99 gigs of storage
I will expereiment this on the second LV that we created.
![ReSize-p2](/images/resizeLV-p2.png)
I looked at the manual and saw that if I wanted to add additional storage I need to use –L option not the lowercase l. 
![ReSize-p3](/images/resizeLV-p3.png)
So the total storage for the LV2 is 40 gigs now it used to be 10. 
So now if we did this on an LV that had an FS we would use the command grow_fs
But in our case we need to make a fs and mount it. 
Here is how it would look like in LV1. Some thing like this 
![ReSize-p4](/images/resizeLV-p4.png)
So in the end it should look something like this 
![ReSize-p5](/images/resizeLV-p5.png)
![ReSize-p6](/images/resizeLV-p6.png)

### Encrypting the LVM

Now that we have finnaly achived our LVM setup and have everything ready we can on top of that simulate some sort of encryption.
We can accomlish that using LUKS encryption 
I don’t really know much about it but it allows us to use symetric encryption to secure our LVM partitons. This also simulates data at rest.
I will be doing this on LV2, cos we need a clean LV with no FS and mountpoint.
So we will be using it like this 
![Encrypt-p1](/images/EncryptionLVM-p1.png)
Just create a passphrase, the real encryption is in the background.
